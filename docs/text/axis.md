# Axis

*Inherits*: [Group](/docs/group) > [Element](/docs/element)

A single vertical or horizontal axis for plotting. This includes the central line, the perpendicual ticks, and their associated tick labels. Note that the proper bounds encompass only the central line and ticks, while the tick labels may fall well outside of them. Use **HAxis** and **VAxis** for specific directions.

Parameters:
- `direc` — the orientation of the axis, either `v` (vertical) or `h` (horizontal)
- `ticks` — a list of tick `[location, label]` pairs. The label can either be an `Element` or a string
- `lim` = `[0, 1]` — the extent of the element along the main axis
- `tick_pos` = `'both'` — one of `'inner'` / `'outer'` / `'both'` / `'none'` , or a pair representing a numerical range in `[0, 1]`, where zero is oriented in the inner direction

Subunits:
- `line`: the central line along the main axis
- `tick`: the perpendicular tick marks (collectively)
- `label`: the labels annotating the tick marks (collectively)
