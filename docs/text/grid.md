# Grid

*Inherits*: [Group](/docs/group) > [Element](/docs/element)

This element creates a container that arranges its children in a grid. The grid is specified by the number of rows and columns, and the gap between the cells. In the case where `widths` and `heights` are not specified, a reasonable effort is made to best accomodate the grid elements based on their aspects (if specified).

Parameters:
- `rows` = `N` — the number of rows in the grid (autodetected)
- `cols` = `M` — the number of columns in the grid (autodetected)
- `widths` = `[1/N,...]` — an array of widths for each column
- `heights` = `[1/M,...]` — an array of heights for each row
- `spacing` = `0` — the gap between the cells in the grid
