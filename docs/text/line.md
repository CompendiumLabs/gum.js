# Line

*Inherits*: [Element](/docs/element)

The `Line` element is a basic geometric element that draws a line between two points. There are specialized variants for vertical and horizontal lines called **VLine** and **HLine**, which allow you to specify the position of the line (`loc`) and the range of the line (`lim`). See [UnitLine](/docs/unitline) for more details.

Parameters:
- `pos1` — the coordinate of the first point
- `pos2` — the coordinate of the second point
