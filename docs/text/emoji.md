# Emoji

*Inherits*: [Element](/docs/Element)

Creates a new `Emoji` element from a Github emoji name (like "smile" = "ðŸ™‚"). Note that you do not need to include the ":" characters around the name.

You can find a list of the Github emoji names [here](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet). If the emoji is not found, it will display the name in red. Note that you can also simply use the **Text** element to display an emoji by passing the emoji character itself as the text, rather than the name.

Parameters:
- `name` â€” the name of the emoji
