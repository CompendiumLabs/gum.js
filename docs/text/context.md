# Context

This is the class the handles the flow of information down the [Element](/docs/element) chain as rendering happens. Essentially, it contains information about the absolute location (in pixels) of the current Element and provides methods for mapping from coordinate positions within that Element (such as `[0.3, 0.6]`) to pixel positions (such as `[100, 250]`).

The most commonly used would be `mapPoint` for positions, `mapRect` for areas, and `mapSize` for sizes. These are used as the core logic in most custom Element classes. See [Element](/docs/element) for more information on their proper usage in that setting.

The `map` function is used generate a subcontext for child elements. The input `rect` specifies where to place the child in the coordinate system of the parent, while the `coord` argument specifies a new coordinate system for the child to use. The canonical usage of the `coord` argument is in [Graph](/docs/graph), where we want to place the graph in a particular spot but specify child positions in an arbitrary coordinate system.

For children with `null` aspects, this is the end of the story. However, when the child aspect is specified, we may not be able to fit it into `rect` snugly. In this case we either shrink it down so that if fits both vertically or horizontally (`expand = false`) or blow it up until it (weakly) exceeds its bounds in both directions (`expand = true`). Related complications are introduced when `rotate` is non-null. See [Group](/docs/group) for a list of inputs to `map`.

Methods:
- `constructor({ prect, coord })`: create a new `Context`
- `mapPoint(point)`: map a coordinate position to a pixel position
- `mapRect(rect)`: map a coordinate rectangle to a pixel rectangle
- `mapSize(size)`: map a coordinate size to a pixel size
- `mapRange(direc, limit)`: map a coordinate range to a pixel range
- `map({ rect, aspect, expand, align, rotate, invar })`: return a sub-`Context` for a given coordinate rectangle
